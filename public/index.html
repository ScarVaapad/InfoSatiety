                            If you agree to take part in this research, you will be firstly asked to take two surveys which give us your basic demographic information, a brief description of your personality and your ability to comprehend visualizations, note that none of the tests are designed to penalize your further effort. Then, you are asked to read a series of scatterplots, which you can interact with a slider bar to show how many data is revealed. You need to decide how much data is enough for you to draw a trendline to represent a linear relationship of the two variables, and part of your compensation is based on your accuracy and efficient use of data (detailed explained later with examples). After the tasks, you are invited to a post-task questionnaire where you will be asked open-ended questions as well as address your concerns. Your participation in this study will take less than 25 minutes. You can choose to stop taking the study at any time.</p>
